## Usage

The table above is generated by the script [`git-repos.py`](git-repos.py). If you wish to use it to generate your own table of repos, follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repo:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kelly-sovacool/meta-repo
    ```

1. Change the URL to your own GitHub repo:

    ```
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
    ```

1. Install dependencies:

    ```
    conda env create -n git-repos -f environment.yaml
    conda activate git-repos
    ```

1. Update the README file with a table of your projects with:

    ```
    python git-repos.py --username your_username
    ```
    It will then prompt you for your GitHub password, collect the information from GitHub, and generate the table in [`README.md`](README.md) under the [`Projects`](#projects) subheading. It will only include repositories which you own or which you have contributed to.

    By default it will exclude private repos from the table.
    If you wish to include them, use the flag `--include_private`:
    ```
    python git-repos.py --username your_username --include_private
    ```

## TO-DO
- Merge the functionality of [lang-stats](https://api.github.com/repos/kelly-sovacool/lang-stats) into this project.
- Option to use API token instead of GitHub username & password.
