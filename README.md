## Usage

The [table above](#current) and [plots below](#plots) are generated by the script [`git-repos.py`](git-repos.py).

### Setup

1. Clone this repo:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/kelly-sovacool/meta-repo
    ```

1. Change the URL to your own GitHub repo:

    ```
    git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git
    ```

1. Install dependencies:

    ```
    conda env create -n git-repos -f environment.yaml
    conda activate git-repos
    ```

### Run it

Get your repos & make plots with:

```
python git-repos.py --username your_username
```

It will then prompt you for your GitHub password, collect the information from GitHub, and generate the table in [`README.md`](README.md) under the [`Projects`](#projects) subheading.
[Plots](##plots) of programming language statistics are written to [`figures/`](figures/).
Only repositories which you own or which you have contributed to are included.

Alternatively, you can supply an [access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) instead of your username & password.
Paste the token into a plain text file and use the `--token` option:

```
python git-repos.py --token path_to_token
```

#### Private repos

By default, private repos are excluded from the table.
However, they are always included in statistics for plots.
If you wish to include them, use the flag `--include_private`:

```
python git-repos.py --token path_to_token --include_private
```
or
```
python git-repos.py --username your_username --include_private
```


## Plots

Plots of programming language statistics are written to [`figures/`](figures/).

## TO-DO

- Jupyter is way over-represented because `.ipynb` files are JSON with lots of metadata.
    - It'd be cool to parse out the code chunks and only let code count towards the byte count.
    - Does linguist count comments in regular text files (e.g. `.py` or `.R`) towards the code byte count?
    - Try counting bytes in regular `.py` files to make sure my method matches that of linguist, then apply it to Jupyter code chunks stripped of metadata.
